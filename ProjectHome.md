odeToJava is a modular object-oriented framework that allows the user to implement many types of IVPs (initial value problems) for ODEs (ordinary differential equations), along with the associated IVP methods.  It also includes basic test facilities to test combinations of IVPs, IVP methods, and step-control parameters.  The IVPs included are two IVP tested sets and a number of representative problems from the literature.  The methods included are many ERK (explicit Runge-Kutta) methods and ARK (additive Runge-Kutta) methods.
